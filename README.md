# airbattle-docker

This is a repo to be able to easily run a modified instance of the game AIRMASH using community-remade components. I've made changes to the components to address issues and add features that I wanted.

This uses the following repos:

- [ab-frontend](https://github.com/parsehex/ab-frontend) - fork of [airmash-frontend](https://github.com/airmash-refugees/airmash-frontend)
- [ab-server](https://github.com/parsehex/ab-server) - fork of [ab-server](https://github.com/wight-airmash/ab-server)
- [ab-bot](https://github.com/parsehex/ab-bot) - fork of [AB-bot](https://github.com/spatiebot/ab-bot)

## Setup

1. Install nvm and node 12
   - Windows: Download and run the latest `nvm-setup.exe` from [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)

2. Install node v12 by running:
